#summary Instructions how to add JAR files to the project without breaking builds

= Introduction =
It may be necessary to integrate an external library into the Rehearse build. You'll have to add the library to:
  # The Eclipse project
  # The make, run and dist scripts for each platform
  # The config.xml file for the Windows launcher

First, decide where the jar files will live. For jars that have to do with the PDE, rehearse/app/lib is a good location. In the following example, assume our jar file is rehearse/app/lib/jj1.0.1.jar

== Change Eclipse .classpath file ==
Either go through the GUI: right click project name, Properties, Java Build Path, Add JARs...
Or edit .classpath and add
{{{
<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/jj1.0.1.jar"/>
}}}

== Change make,run,dist scripts ==
The files live in rehearse/build/[platformname]/.
For example: 
{{{
rehease/build/windows/make.sh
rehease/build/windows/run.sh
rehease/build/windows/dist.sh
}}}
=== make.sh ===
Steps:
  # copy jars into work directory
  # add jars to classpath
  # if you have any new source packages, add to list of files to compile
