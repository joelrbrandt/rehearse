Here's how to get Rehearse up and running in Eclipse:

1. Check out the code using the following command:
{{{
svn checkout https://rehearse.googlecode.com/svn/rehearse-processing/trunk/ rehearse --username [your username]
}}}

When prompted for your password, get it from here (it's *not* your usual google account password -- instead it's something auto-generated by google):
  http://code.google.com/hosting/settings

2. Import the following directories from step 1 as Eclipse projects:
  * build
  * core
  * dxf
  * net
  * opengl
  * pdf
  * app (processing)
  * serial
  * video

3. Add all of the above directories to the "processing" project's classpath in Eclipse.  To do this, right-click on "processing" in the Package Explorer and select "Properties".  Under "Java Build Path" make sure the checkboxes next to all the above projects are checked.

4. To include the Processing examples in the IDE you must manually unzip the file:
  build > shared > examples.zip
and place the resulting "examples" directory here:
  app > examples

5. To run Rehearse, run the following file as a Java application:
  processing/src/edu/stanford/hci/processing/RehearseBase.java
