#summary "Release Version" of Rehearse.

= Introduction =

A new branch called "releaseVersion" has been created under rehearse-processing/branches to hold the clean version of Rehearse fit for open-source release.

This is the primary plan: there will be three different folders under the releaseVersion branch:
  * The latest Processing source code in rehearse-processing/branches/releaseVersion/processing
  * The latest Bean Shell code in rehearse-processing/branches/releaseVersion/bsh
  * All new code that we add for Rehearse will be modularized and put in rehearse-processing/branches/releaseVersion/rehearse
