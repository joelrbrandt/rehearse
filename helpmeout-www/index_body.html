<h2>What is HelpMeOut?</h2>
HelpMeOut is a research project of the Stanford HCI Group. It helps 
users of <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> and <a 
href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> to correct 
bugs in their programs.   

<h2>How do I use HelpMeOut?</h2>
HelpMeOut requires an augmented version of the Processing or Arduino 
IDE. You can 
download Processing builds for Windows and OS X from <a 
href="http://rehearse.stanford.edu/build">rehearse.stanford.edu/build</a>. 
Arduino builds are still in the works.

<h2>Where can I go from here?</h2>
Take a look at a list of <a href="list.psp">Processing fixes that need 
explanations</a>, or a <a href="list.psp?all=1">list of all 
Processing bug 
fixes</a> we have collected. 
<p>Or you can look at similar lists for 
Arduino: <a href="list.psp?db=arduino">Arduino fixes that need 
explanations</a>; <a href="list.psp?all=1&db=arduino">all Arduino 
fixes</a>.
