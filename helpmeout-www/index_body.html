<h2>What is HelpMeOut?</h2>
HelpMeOut is a research project of the Stanford HCI Group. It helps 
users of <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> and <a 
href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> to correct 
bugs in their programs.   

<h2>How does HelpMeOut work?</h2>
HelpMeOut has two different components: a suggestion panel that shows potential bug fixes for the errors in your program, and instrumentation that automatically collects bug fixes by tracking how your code changes over time. These bug fixes are then uploaded to a central database, which the suggestion panel queries whenever you have a new error. 
 
<h2>Where do I get HelpMeOut?</h2>
HelpMeOut is an augmentation to the Processing 
or Arduino IDE. You can 
download Processing builds that include HelpMeOut for Windows and OS X 
from <a 
href="http://rehearse.stanford.edu/build">rehearse.stanford.edu/build</a>. 
Arduino builds are still in the works.

<h2>Where can I go from here?</h2>
Take a look at a list of <a href="list.psp">Processing fixes that need 
explanations</a>, a <a href="list.psp?all=1">list of all 
Processing bug 
fixes</a> we have collected, or a <a href="querylog.psp">list of queries</a> HelpMeOut users have generated.
<p>Or you can look at similar lists for 
Arduino: <a href="list.psp?db=arduino">Arduino fixes that need 
explanations</a>; <a href="list.psp?all=1&db=arduino">all Arduino 
fixes</a>.
