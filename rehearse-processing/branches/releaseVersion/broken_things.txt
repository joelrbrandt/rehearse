1. Class defined later in the code is not recognized by beanshell.
JOEL WILL DO 2. Examples:WaveGradient.pde....bad float unaryOperation error?
             |--> Related to #5?
FIXED 3. Examples:RadialGradient.pde...Argument 1 of color constructor did not eval to a Primitive
FIXED 4. None of the load.. (e.g. loadImage) functions work. Perhaps because of file path issue? All files in the "data" folder must be available.
JOEL WILL DO 5. Examples:Basic>Control>EmbeddedIteration.pde...Variable assignment: j: Can't assign float to int
             |--> Assignment of float to int isn't allowed by beanshell and could be. Problem starts at Primitive.java:1051
FIXED 6. stop button doesn't work
FIXED 7. Basic>Image>BackgroundImage: background function doesn't work?
